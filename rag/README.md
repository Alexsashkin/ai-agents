# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**[COMING SOON]** 

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an AI framework that enhances the accuracy and 
relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them with external knowledge 
sources. RAG combines the power of information retrieval with the generative 
capabilities of LLMs to create more accurate and domain-specific responses.
