# AI Agents

- [`docker-ai-starter-kit`](/docker-ai-starter-kit/README.md) - 
**Docker AI Starter Kit** is an open Docker Compose template that quickly bootstraps 
a fully featured local AI and Low Code development environment, including an Open WebUI 
for the communication interface (chat) with your local LLMs.

- [`rag`]() - **[COMING SOON]** **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** is an AI framework that 
enhances the accuracy and relevance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating them 
with external knowledge sources. RAG combines the power of information retrieval with 
the generative capabilities of LLMs to create more accurate and domain-specific responses. 

- [`mcp`]() - **[COMING SOON]** **Model Context Protocol** is a standardized framework that 
enables AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), to interact with external tools and 
data sources in a structured and efficient way that simplifies the integration of AI with the real world.
